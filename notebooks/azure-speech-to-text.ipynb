      "Thank you for calling Rocket Speed Internet my name is Giza may I please have your phone or account number? I'm sorry can you hear me okay now? I was asking you about your phone or account number. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. I would probably feel the same way if I'm in your situation. But don't worry I promise you that we'll get your issue resolved. Let me get first your account number so we can check your account. Would that be okay? You got it. May I please verify the name on the account? Okay Mr. Robert can we call you back at the same number or do you have a better callback number? Sure I was just asking you if we can call you at the same number you gave me or if you have a better callback number. Okay based on our test results it shows here that you are not getting a DSL signal. That's why you can't get online or check your email. We can actually fix this problem over the phone but I will need to walk you through on some steps. Would that be okay sir? Oh that's good then but can you at least check for me which lights are lighted up on your modem? Okay sir thank you for your patience. As you could notice the DSL light is flashing red on your modem. That means that you are not getting any DSL signal. The good thing is based on your initial test results here we do not have network problems or outages in your area. That means we might be able to fix the problem over the phone. Okay sir you might have already checked on it but since you have the DSL light flashing red on your modem it's telling me right away that there could be something wrong on your DSL line. It's the grey phone cord or the back part of the modem. Well if yes sir if I send someone out and they find out that there's just a loose phone cord then you will get charged for the dispatch. So we want to resolve the problem over the phone. So we could avoid dispatch charges. It will also save your time. That's all we need to check sir. Alright sir don't worry I won't hang up on you. Wow that's good to know let's just see if you can now get online before we hang up. Can you try one or two more websites? No sir you did a great job I was just giving you the steps. You did great today but do you have any more questions or another concern? You are welcome we are open 24 by 7 just in case that you'll need our help again.

      "\n",
      "I'm really sorry for the inconvenience, I would probably feel the same way if I'm in your situation. But don't worry, I promise you that we'll get your issue resolved. Let me get first your account number so we can check your account, would that be okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "You got it, may I please verify the name on the account?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay Mr. Robert, can we call you back at the same number or do you have a better callback number?\n",

      "Okay, based on our test results, it shows here that you are not getting a DSL signal, that's why you can't get online or check your email. We can actually fix this problem over the phone, but I will need to walk you through on some steps, would that be okay sir?\n",

The good thing is, based on your initial test results here, we do not have network problems or outages in your area. That means we might be able to fix the problem over the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay sir, you might have already checked on it, but since we have a DSL light flashing red on your modem, it's telling me right away that there could be something wrong on your DSL line. It's the gray phone cord or the back part of the modem.\n",

      "Well, yes sir, if I send someone out and they find out that there's just a loose phone cord, then you will get charged for the dispatch. So we want to resolve the problem over the phone. So we could avoid dispatch charges, it will also save your time, that's all we need to check sir.\n",

    "The WebSocket-based transcription service provides several advantages over traditional file-based transcription:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-time results**: Transcription happens as you speak, without waiting for the complete audio\n",
    "2. **Continuous streaming**: Audio is sent in small chunks through a persistent connection\n",
    "3. **Turn detection**: Automatically detects speech segments using Voice Activity Detection (VAD)\n",
    "4. **Configurable noise reduction**: Can be optimized for near-field or far-field speech\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TranscriptionService` class in `transcription_websocket_service.py` supports these key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `service_type`: Choose between `\"azure\"` or `\"openai\"` (direct) services\n",
    "- `model`: Specify model (\"gpt-4o-transcribe\" or \"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe\")\n",
    "- `noise_reduction`: Set to \"near_field\" or \"far_field\" for different environments\n",
    "- `turn_threshold`: Sensitivity for voice activity detection (0.0-1.0)\n",
    "- `include_logprobs`: Whether to include confidence scores for transcribed text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For Azure OpenAI service (used in this example):\n",
    "- `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint\n",
    "- `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: The deployment name for your GPT-4o-transcribe model\n",
    "- `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_API_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key\n",
    "\n",
    "For direct OpenAI service (alternative option):\n",
    "- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Official Documentation\n",
